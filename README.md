## Problem statement:
### With the rise of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Deepfakes, and AI-generated images or text, the line between human and machine-created content is becoming increasingly blurred. 
- To develop an AI-powered system that can accurately detect whether a given piece of content (text, image, video, or audio) was generated by a human or an AI model. 
- To analyzing linguistic patterns, metadata, model fingerprints, or inconsistencies in logic and style. 
- To help in content moderation, academic integrity, and media authentication.

## Product Description
AI-Content-Detector-on-AWS. An AI-powered system built with AWS services that detects whether text, documents, images, or audio are generated by humans or AI. Supports multi-modal content analysis, provides confidence scores, and explains reasoning using Amazon Bedrock and other AWS services.

## Technology Stack Used
### Frontend & Styling: 
- Vue.js 3 (vue)
- Vite (vite.config.ts)
- Tailwind CSS (tailwind.config.js)
  
### Backend: 
- Python
  
### Cloud Services - AWS (Amazon Web Services): 
- Amazon API Gateway: Provides a secure public API for the UI to send image requests.
- Amazon Lambda: Lightweight backend logic that connects the UI with AI services.
- Amazon Comprehend: Analyzes text metadata (captions/descriptions) for sentiment and insights.
- Amazon Bedrock (Nova Pro): Generates advanced AI text responses/explanations.
- Amazon SageMaker: Hosts and serves the HuggingFace deepfake-detector model for image classification.
- Amazon S3: Stores input media like documents and images and also processed results.
- Amazon DynamoDB: Saves detection results, metadata, and user activity logs.
- Amazon CloudWatch: Monitors logs, errors, and performance for the entire system.
